# How to Play
DEO Board Controls: The first slider switch “SW0” allows
the player to choose between the real game and training mode.
This is shown on the seven-segment display.“Button2”
allows the player to reset the game at any time.

Mouse Controls: “Left click” makes the helicopter traverse
up. One can keep it pressed or click in periods to throttle up.
“Right click” makes the helicopter swing in a horizontal
parabola. This is useful for dodging bombs. “Middle mouse
click” pauses the game or sends the player back to menu when
they die.
